  integers      n ∈ ℤ
  expressions   e ::= n
                    | (+ e e)

+------------+
|  e |-> e'  |   e steps to e'
+------------+

    n = n1 + n2               
  ––––––––––––––– step-add
  (+ n1 n2) |-> n

       e1 |-> e1'
–––––––––––––––––––––––– step-add-left
(+ e1 e2) |-> (+ e1' e2)

       e2 |-> e2'
–––––––––––––––––––––––– step-add-right
(+ e1 e2) |-> (+ e1 e2')


    (+ n n) |-> 2n
 is equivalent to
    the judgment (+ n n) |-> 2n holds
    the judgment (+ n n) |-> 2n is derivable
    there exists a derivation of (+ n n) |-> 2n
    there exists D deriving (+ n n) |-> 2n   (gives the name D to the derivation)

Theorem 1.
For all integers n, it is the case that  (+ n n) |-> 2n.

A theorem is like a machine: (a proof is like a machine)
this one takes an integer  n  and produces a derivation of (+ n n) |-> 2n.


Is the judgment (+ 3 3) |-> 7 derivable?
(equivalently)
Is there a derivation of (+ 3 3) |-> 7?
Answer:
  not by step-add, because we could get (+ 3 3) |-> 6, but not (+ 3 3) |-> 7
  by step-add-left?  3 |-> ...? no, can't derive the first premise of step-add-left
  by step-add-right? 3 |-> ...? no, can't derive the first premise of step-add-right
  no

Is the judgment (+ 3 3) |-> 0 derivable?
  by similar reasoning, no

Theorem 2 takes a derivation (of  (+ n n) |-> e')
and shows that e' = 2n.

[
  If D1 derives (+ n n) |-> (+ 2n 0)    <- we can't construct this
  then (+ 2n 0) = 2n
]

Renamed n to m in Theorem 2 statement to avoid name clash.

Theorem 2.
  For all expressions e', if D1 derives (+ m m) |-> e'
  then e' = 2m.
Proof:
"What do I know? What am I trying to prove?"
  thing                    justification (why thing is true)
  ======================   ==============================================
 [e' is an expression   ]  (yes, but we always know that, because if we write
                            e', e' is an expression)
  (+ m m) |-> e'           Above

Which rule could have been used to derive (+ m m) |-> e' ?

Consider cases of the rule concluding D1:

  • step-add:
    Assume we used step-add.

    To answer this, first look at the form of the conclusion of step-add;
    n1 can be m, n2 can be m, n can be e'.
    Conclusion is okay.
    Now we check the premise:
      Is it possible that n = n1 + n2?
      Is it possible that n = m + m?  Sure, that's possible
    n = m + m                By inversion (because we know we used step-add)
    n = e'                   By inversion (because we know we used step-add)
    n = 2m                   By arithmetic (2m = m + m)
    e' = 2m                  By above equations

(answering a question
  m + m = 2m

  If m = 5, then 10 |-> 10
)
  • step-add-left:
    Assume we used step-add-left.

    (+ e1 e2) |-> (+ e1' e2)
    (+ m  m ) |-> e'

    m = e1                  By inversion (because we used step-add-left)
    m = e2                  By inversion (because we used step-add-left)
   e' = (+ e1' e2)          By inversion (because we used step-add-left)
[INVERSION gives two things:
   (1) equations from lining up the conclusion of the rule with
       the conclusion of the given derivation
   (2) the premises of the rule]
   e1 |-> e1'               By inversion (because we used step-add-left)
    m |-> e1'               By above equation
    No rule can derive m |-> e1'
    ( Consider cases of the rule deriving m |-> e1':
        get contradiction for all three)
    contradiction

  • step-add-right
    Assume we used step-add-right.
    Exercise:
      Write this out in approximately as much detail as the step-add-left case

[When we consider cases, we have to show the same thing in every case.
 That is, we need to show e' = 2m.
 In the step-add case, we showed e' = 2m directly.
 In the step-add-left case, we can look at it in two different ways:

   First way: We showed e' = 2m because we got a contradiction, and you can prove anything from a contradiction.

   Second way: We obtained a contradiction, which showed that the step-add-left case was impossible.]

  In all cases (once you've done the step-add-right case),
  e' = 2m
